# Air-Quality-Index-Analysis


The "Air Quality Index Analysis" project is a comprehensive exploration of air quality parameters with the goal of understanding and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) for different cities. The project encompasses a diverse set of features, including city details, date, and various air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene. The target variables are AQI and AQI_Bucket.

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Data was collected from diverse sources, aggregating information on air quality parameters for various cities.
   - The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Statistical methods were applied to uncover key characteristics and trends in the data.
   - Visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create insightful charts and graphs, aiding in the exploration of relationships between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - The dataset underwent feature engineering to extract relevant information and enhance the predictive power of the model.
